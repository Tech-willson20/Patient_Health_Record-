# Patient_Health_Record
The Patient Health Record System is a simple Python-based application that allows users to record, search, and edit patient health information
The system manages patient details such as name, age, weight, height, cholesterol level, and calculates key health indicators like BMI (Body Mass Index) and cholesterol levels. 
The system is menu-driven, allowing users to interact with it through a series of prompts.

Scenario: Managing Patient Health Records in a Small Clinic

Objective: A small clinic wants to maintain a simple, digital record of patients' basic health information. The clinic needs to:
1.	Enter new patient records when a patient visits for the first time.
2.	Search for existing records when a patient returns for follow-up visits.
3.	Edit records to update any changes in patient details or to correct any errors in the initial entry.

Workflow:
•	New Patient Visit:
o	The clinic staff selects the option to "Enter New Records".
o	The staff enters the patient's details as prompted by the system.
o	The system calculates the patient's age, BMI, and cholesterol category and stores the information.
o	A health summary is generated and displayed for confirmation.
•	Returning Patient:
o	The staff selects the option to "Search Patient".
o	They enter the patient's last name to retrieve the record.
o	The system displays the patient's health summary.
•	Editing a Record:
o	If the patient's details need updating, the staff selects the "Edit or Update Patient Detail" option.
o	They select the patient from the list and choose the field to edit.
o	The system updates the record with the new information and recalculates any affected values (e.g., age or BMI).
•	Exiting:
o	The staff selects the "Exit" option to close the application.

*#CONCLUSION*
This system provides a straightforward way to manage patient health records in a small clinic setting. 
The menu-driven interface makes it easy to use, and the built-in calculations help ensure that patient health indicators are up-to-date and accurate. 
This code can be further expanded or modified to fit specific needs or integrated into larger health record management systems.
